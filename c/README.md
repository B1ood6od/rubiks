<h2>Rubiks Based Encryption</h2>

<p>This is a Rubiks based encryption, built in C. It is in an absolutely basic form, but works. Future updates may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using unicode rather than ASCII</li>
  <li>Fancy fancy math to obfuscate input</li>
</ul>
<p>encryption_q is a quickly thrown together program to attempt to break the textual output of the ecryption via brute force</p>
