<h2>Rubiks Based Encryption</h2>

<p>Here we have something a sane human being would never create. An encryption that allows someone to put full messages on a Rubiks cube! This is mostly for some programming and encryption practice; but I suppose it could be useful to someone, somewhere.</p>
<p>Possible future updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using unicode rather than ASCII</li>
  <li>Fancy fancy math to obfuscate input</li>
  <li>Adding more puzzles
    <ul>
      <li>4x4</li>
      <li>5x5</li>
      <li>Minx family</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show encrypted message on generated cube (ugh, gui)</li>
  <li>Completely remake the encryption, to allow decryption</li>
</ul>
